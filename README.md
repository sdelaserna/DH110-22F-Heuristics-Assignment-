## One Less Hungry Person | UN's Sustainability Goal: Zero Hunger
### Stacey Amery Dela Serna in DH110 F22

### Project Proposal
Zero Hunger is an important goal to me because in high school I led a class discussion on food deserts, food waste, and how to lessen food waste in our personal lives. My parents are also immigrants from the Philippines and stressed the importance of having good food to eat everyday. I would like everyone to have access to nutritional, whole food at a reasonable price because I recognize the impact it has on our minds and body particularly during the developmental stage at life.

FoodPantries.Org is a website created by a single person that just wanted to create a directory of Food Banks, Soup Kitchens, and non-profit organizations committed to fighting hunger. The information is collected manually and accurate to the best of their knowledge. In comparison to College of the Desert, the scale is on a national level which can narrow down on the city level. With better design, this could be more appealing to use and therefore the resources would be shared more too.  

### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation 

1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority


### First Site: College of the Desert

https://www.collegeofthedesert.edu/

College of the Desert is my community college website that I went to during my first two years of college. I wanted to zone in on the UN’s Zero Hunger Project to my local area to make it more accessible and more compassion to work with since I grew up in that area for more than 10 years. They have a listing about food pantries, but it’s very bare and hard to get to. Whenever I used that website, I thought it always needed help with UX/UI. If the UX/UI is revised, then it will be easier to find listings of the food pantries.

#### 1: Visibility of System Status

##### The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

**(3)** Finding the food distribution page is really difficult n this website and is very embedded into the site. From previous experience, finding anything on your own on this website is difficult. 

*Recommendation: Make the search bar more prominent at the top right corner* 


#### 2: Match between System and the Real World
##### The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

**(2)** Searching through this website is difficult and made in English. There is a translation button, however it's only on the Academic Programs page. Also, it’s Google Translate and not everything is perfect. Most likely college aged and educated, will be using this site, however, it should be more simplified and the access to all languages should be available for every page. 

![screen shot of translate button](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/cod%20academic%20programs.png)

*Recommendation: Have the translation button above the search bar for every page.*


#### 3: User Control and Freedom
##### Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.

**(1)** I think there is heavy reliance on the use of the back page of the browser rather than the actual website. There really is no emergency exit, except for the web mapping at the top of the page. However, using that will take you back to the top of the previous page rather than the previous location on that same page. But for the most part, users are free to click on anything they like even on the pictures of the homepage which allows for lots of flexibility. 

#### 4: Consistency and Standards
##### Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.

**(2)** There is consistency in how the website is formatted when looking at the subpages: all the topics or questions are on the right hand side on the blue box titled with a bold white text in a darker blue box. However, the format of the content is not consistent and there’s too many boxes and fonts in my opinion which is why it makes the difficult unseemingly hard to navigate through. 

*Recommendation: Have a clearer template to work off of. User submenus so it's not too much for the user. *  

#### 5: Error Prevention
##### Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

**(2)** When looking at the catalog, there is a search tab, but it’s a blank page. If that’s the case, just get rid of it. For the search bar for the whole website, it does not prevent

![no error message in the catalog](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/bad%20search%20results.png) 

#### 6: Recognition Rather than Recall
##### Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.

**(3)** The link to the food banks in the Coachella area is on a PDF. All the cities and food banks available are listed right there. So people can easily recognize which city they belong to. However, there seems to be no logic in how the food banks are listed. 

*Recommendation: Instead, it should be in alphabetical order and there should be a link to their website or instagram if they have any. Also rather than jumping to a new tab on a PDF, they should have the resource available right on the page or just have both options available. This site is definitely not accessible to those who are on their phone.*


#### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
##### Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

**(3)** When looking at the table for the food bank, there is no personalization/customization. If they want the exact information, they’re gonna have to copy and paste the excel sheet into their own program. The only accelerator to this page is using the control + F button to find your nearest food pantry in the city of your choice.

*Recommendation: They could add filters if the information was on the webpage rather than the PDF.*


#### 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
##### Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

**(3)**  The website needs a lot of help. It feels very outdated due to the excessive shadowing on the top 3 tabs of the website bar. Also the three tabs on the top have excessive shadow when nowadays it would be used strategically. The homepage is really cluttered visually and I feel like with better design, we could minimize throwing everything on the homepage. Sticking to a color palette is great for starters. I like that the font is consistent throughout the whole website even when I don’t like the font personally myself.

*Recommendation: Include more interactive elements to further cater to a younger audience and make a more effective educational tool (i.e. allowing user to move items into appropriate bins, etc)*


#### 9: Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

Search bar error message is concise and constructive. However through some trials it does seem to not pick up on misspelled terms or inconcise searches. **(1)**

![screen shot of search bar error message]

*Recommendation: Provide suggestions for misspelled words/related ideas.*


#### 10: Help and Documentation

There is no designated “Help” section of the site. If a user is confused on how to navigate certain elements they are not guided. **(1)**

*Recommendation: Incorporate a help icon or a FAQs section into the menu bar for users looking to learn more.*


### Second site: LACompost

https://www.lacompost.org/start-composting 

The next site I’ve analyzed is more aligned in terms of what my intended project will do (locating spaces near you to compost food waste). The website is successful in conveying the necessary information with little to no issues. However, the user could be given more freedom and the design could be adjusted to better reflect their intentions and ameliorate the user's experience.

![screen shot of home page]


#### 1: Visibility of System Status

When a user selects “View all available locations” they are brought to other educational pamphlets before the map of locations. This makes for a disconnect between what the user wants to see and what they are being shown. **(2)**

![screen shot of find function of site]

*Recommendation: Lead users directly to an interactive map of locations and provide other information secondarily (perhaps as a legend in the map).*


#### 2: Match between System and the Real World

The site uses easily comprehensible visual elements as well as vocabulary to convey their intended message. **(0)**

*No improvements.*


#### 3: User Control and Freedom

When users click on the Shop page of the site they are led to an external site on a separate tab. They need to change tabs again to get back to the original site. **(1)**

![screen shot of site reroute to Shop page]

*Recommendation: If possible incorporate the Shop portion into the main site opposed to having a separate website that is externally linked.*


#### 4: Consistency and Standards

“About” section is located first in the menu bar rather than a “Home” section or the page dedicated to the practical intention of the site. **(1)**

![screen shot of site Menu bar]

*Recommendation: Move about section closer to the end of menu bar.*


#### 5: Error Prevention

No errors encountered. **(0)**

*No improvements.*


#### 6: Recognition Rather than Recall

The menu bar doesn’t indicate which page the user is currently reading so the user may get confused when scrolling down the page as to what part of the site they are on. **(1)**

*Recommendation: Have the menu bar indicate which page of the site the user is accessing at that moment.*


#### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

There is a “Jump Straight to Farmers Market” option for those looking for easy access to the map view of location sites. However, in order to use this function one would have to have sufficient knowledge of what it is they are searching for (i.e. a “farmers’ market” as opposed to a “drop off site” or other term). Additionally, there is no search bar apparent on the site. Users have to manually navigate. **(2)**

![screen shot of location map]

*Recommendation: Add a search bar to help users navigate the site more quickly.*


#### 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

PDF documents are uploaded on the site for further information. However, the size shown is too zoomed in and doesn’t allow the user to adjust viewing size unless it is downloaded. Additionally, some PDFs uploaded are blurry. **(2)**

![screen shot of blurry PDF document]

*Recommendation: Allow users to view PDF at desired size on the site itself. And improve image quality of documents uploaded.*


#### 9: Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

N/a. No error messages encountered. **(0)**

*No improvements.*


#### 10: Help and Documentation

No FAQ section or Help documentation. **(1)**

*Recommendation: Add a “Frequently Asked Questions” section for additional help and information. And possibly a chat box in order to help users in need of additional information.*
