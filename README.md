## One Less Hungry Person | UN's Sustainability Goal: Zero Hunger
### Stacey Amery Dela Serna in DH110 F22

### Project Proposal
Zero Hunger is an important goal to me because in high school I led a class discussion on food deserts, food waste, and how to lessen food waste in our personal lives. My parents are also immigrants from the Philippines and stressed the importance of having good food to eat everyday. I would like everyone to have access to nutritional, whole food at a reasonable price because I recognize the impact it has on our minds and body particularly during the developmental stage at life.

### Severity Ratings in Heuristic Evaluation 

1 = Cosmetic problem only: need not be fixed unless extra time is available on project

2 = Minor usability problem: fixing this should be given low priority

3 = Major usability problem: important to fix, so should be given high priority


### First Site: College of the Desert

https://www.collegeofthedesert.edu/

College of the Desert is my community college website that I went to during my first two years of college. I wanted to zone in on the UN’s Zero Hunger Project to my local area to make it more accessible and more compassionate to work with since I grew up in that area for more than 10 years. I also love my community college experience! 

They have a listing about food pantries, but it’s very bare and hard to get to. Whenever I used that website, I thought it always needed help with UX/UI. If the UX/UI is revised, then it will be easier to find listings of the food pantries. Also the students who go to this community college and need the food resource the most might not even be aware of it, nor may they have the means to check out all the locations provided on that list.

#### 1: Visibility of System Status

##### The design should always keep users informed about what is going on, through appropriate feedback within a reasonable amount of time.

**(3)** Finding the food distribution page is really difficult n this website and is very embedded into the site. From previous experience, finding anything on your own on this website is difficult. 

*Recommendation: Make the search bar more prominent at the top right corner* 


#### 2: Match between System and the Real World
##### The design should speak the users' language. Use words, phrases, and concepts familiar to the user, rather than internal jargon. Follow real-world conventions, making information appear in a natural and logical order.

**(2)** Searching through this website is difficult and made in English. There is a translation button, however it's only on the Academic Programs page. Also, it’s Google Translate and not everything is perfect. Most likely college aged and educated, will be using this site, however, it should be more simplified and the access to all languages should be available for every page. 

![screen shot of translate button](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/cod%20academic%20programs.png)

*Recommendation: Have the translation button above the search bar for every page.*


#### 3: User Control and Freedom
##### Users often perform actions by mistake. They need a clearly marked "emergency exit" to leave the unwanted action without having to go through an extended process.

**(1)** I think there is heavy reliance on the use of the back page of the browser rather than the actual website. There really is no emergency exit, except for the web mapping at the top of the page. However, using that will take you back to the top of the previous page rather than the previous location on that same page. But for the most part, users are free to click on anything they like even on the pictures of the homepage which allows for lots of flexibility. 

#### 4: Consistency and Standards
##### Users should not have to wonder whether different words, situations, or actions mean the same thing. Follow platform and industry conventions.

**(2)** There is consistency in how the website is formatted when looking at the subpages: all the topics or questions are on the right hand side on the blue box titled with a bold white text in a darker blue box. However, the format of the content is not consistent and there’s too many boxes and fonts in my opinion which is why it makes the difficult unseemingly hard to navigate through. 

*Recommendation: Have a clearer template to work off of. User submenus so it's not too much for the user. *  

#### 5: Error Prevention
##### Good error messages are important, but the best designs carefully prevent problems from occurring in the first place. Either eliminate error-prone conditions, or check for them and present users with a confirmation option before they commit to the action.

**(2)** When looking at the catalog, there is a search tab, but it’s a blank page. If that’s the case, just get rid of it. For the search bar for the whole website, it does not prevent

![no error message in the catalog](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/bad%20search%20results.png) 

#### 6: Recognition Rather than Recall
##### Minimize the user's memory load by making elements, actions, and options visible. The user should not have to remember information from one part of the interface to another. Information required to use the design (e.g. field labels or menu items) should be visible or easily retrievable when needed.

**(3)** The link to the food banks in the Coachella area is on a PDF. All the cities and food banks available are listed right there. So people can easily recognize which city they belong to. However, there seems to be no logic in how the food banks are listed. 

*Recommendation: Instead, it should be in alphabetical order and there should be a link to their website or instagram if they have any. Also rather than jumping to a new tab on a PDF, they should have the resource available right on the page or just have both options available. This site is definitely not accessible to those who are on their phone.*


#### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use
##### Shortcuts — hidden from novice users — may speed up the interaction for the expert user such that the design can cater to both inexperienced and experienced users. Allow users to tailor frequent actions.

**(3)** When looking at the table for the food bank, there is no personalization/customization. If they want the exact information, they’re gonna have to copy and paste the excel sheet into their own program. The only accelerator to this page is using the control + F button to find your nearest food pantry in the city of your choice.

![screen shot of cod food pantry list](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/food%20pantry%20pdf.png) 

*Recommendation: They could add filters if the information was on the webpage rather than the PDF.*


#### 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design
##### Interfaces should not contain information that is irrelevant or rarely needed. Every extra unit of information in an interface competes with the relevant units of information and diminishes their relative visibility.

**(3)**  The website needs a lot of help. It feels very outdated due to the excessive shadowing on the top 3 tabs of the website bar. Also the three tabs on the top have excessive shadow when nowadays it would be used strategically. The homepage is really cluttered visually and I feel like with better design, we could minimize throwing everything on the homepage. Sticking to a color palette is great for starters. I like that the font is consistent throughout the whole website even when I don’t like the font personally myself. 

![screen shot of site home page again](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/cluttered%20homepage.png) 

*Recommendation: Have submenus and incorporate another moving banner. Decipher who is going to be landing on the College of the Desert website the most because as of right now, it seems like it's trying to catch everyone's attention.* 


#### 9: Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors
##### Error messages should be expressed in plain language (no error codes), precisely indicate the problem, and constructively suggest a solution.

**(1)** wWen inserting an incorrect word on the search query for the whole website, it will try to suggest alternative spelling that has results. The error message itself says, “Sorry, no results were found for _________.” The text was in blue on a blank search result page.

![screen shot of search bar error message](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/critique%20on%20search%20bar%20again.png) 

*Recommendation: It should be highlighted in a light red box and with instructions such as: “Please try again.” .*


#### 10: Help and Documentation
##### It’s best if the system doesn’t need any additional explanation. However, it may be necessary to provide documentation to help users understand how to complete their tasks.

**(1)** The search button is easily recognizable at the top right corner with a yellow box and magnifying glass. It makes it easy for the user to ask for help. There is also an ai chat at the bottom of the screen which prompts user to ask questions to “roadrunner.” 

*Recommendation: No reccomendations. Just redundant that there's two search bars, but I realize both is necessary as the Roadrunner AI prompts the user right away which is better for college students who are not so used navigating technology and websites.*

#### Overall Evaluation of College of the Desert:
**(2)** College of the Desert needs to have more emphasis on the student resources and better organizational skills for the whole website. The search bar alleviates the strain on trying to remember the location of links, however, the user shouldn't think about having to remember that much in the first place. Even when navigating through the other pages, it's too much scrolling. A submenu that follows the user as it scrolls down would help or anchors would help too. It would also be really helpful if they provided links to the instagrams of the food banks available. The heuristic that needs the most help is: #8, #2, and #1. 


### Second site: FoodPantries.Org

https://www.lacompost.org/start-composting 

FoodPantries.Org is a website created by a single person that just wanted to create a directory of Food Banks, Soup Kitchens, and non-profit organizations committed to fighting hunger. The information is collected manually and accurate to the best of their knowledge. In comparison to College of the Desert, the scale is on a national level which can narrow down on the city level. With better design, this could be more appealing to use and therefore the resources would be shared more too.  

![screen shot of home page](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/Food%20Pantries%20Org%20Homepage.png)


#### 1: Visibility of System Status

**(1)** Location is on the right hand side. It’s easy to find where things are since the information is straight foward. Not too many embeddings. The about blurb about food pantries/org is hidden through the plus corner of the site and should be on the fore front of the page – government affiliated or not. However, for everything else, when the mouse hovers over anything, there is an immediate feedback either through the font color changing with an underline underneath it, or the icon flipping like a switch, or the mouse cursor turning into a typing or finger pointing icon rather than the usual triangle pointer. 

![screen shot of find function of site](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/Food%20Pantries%20Org%20Homepage.png) 

*Recommendation: Rather than having the blurb about the site on the top right corner hidden, it should just be on the bottom of the page when you scroll down. It's hard to see the little plus corner at the top.*


#### 2: Match between System and the Real World

**(3)** The three icons show a highlight when the mouse hovers over the text – suggesting that the user can click on it and navigate to more information about that column, but it doesn’t allow that and stays on the homepage. Also, Language is only in English and there is no translate button at the top. For example, people who are in Coachella Valley are part of the Latinx community and if they need these resources, a friend or a relative might have to translate and navigate the website for them

![screen shot with a closer examination of homepage elements](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/misleading%20highlight.png)

*Recommendation: Have the columns be clickable where it can talk more about the process or data visualization of all the food pantries in the U.S. Something more interactive than just a column. *


#### 3: User Control and Freedom

**(2)** There are multiple entries to input the closest food pantries such as address, city (typing it in) or finding it on a list. It's redundant to have the address and the city with the state as well because there is many chances for user to mess up. Honestly, entering in the city could be autofilled to make the design simpler, rather than having two separate options to enter the city. 

![screen shot of site closest food pantries](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/multiple%20entries%20for%20searching.png) 

*Recommendation: Autofilling with suggestions of address when the input from the user becomes more precise.*


#### 4: Consistency and Standards

**(2)** The search entries of city and or state should be available on the front page right away rather than just the state. It makes it more redundant for the user to go through all the cities to find the nearest food pantry. It should also be a quick autofill where the drop down menu decreases the more correct input is put on the search query. 
**(1)** The search bar should be the same color scheme and style to be on this website. 

![screen shot of home search bar](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/search%20bar%201.png)
![screen shot of site second search bar](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/search%20bar%202.png)

*Recommendation: Change the search bar to look the same. If possible, also have the search bar be on the same location even if it's a different page.*


#### 5: Error Prevention

**3** When misspelling a city or address, the page will prompt with words that says: “We could not find the address you are trying to find food near.’ Please try again by entering the full information below.” and “Warning! The City is blank.” Another search query is prompted right below it even though there is one next to it on the right side. There are a couple issues with this error message. The wording is off since it says find twice in one sentence. The Warning! message is fine. However, the two search queries are redundant and does not help the user anymore. 

![screen shot of warning message](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/redundant%20search%20bar.png)

*Recommendations: Delete one of the search bars. Have an arrow pointing the original search bar again instead.*


#### 6: Recognition Rather than Recall

**(1)** Similar to the COD website, they list out all the states and counties available so it’s easier to recognize the location without having to worry whether it’s spelled correctly or not. I like that the actionable items on the page are usually highlighted in orange or surrounding an orange text box. 

![screen shot of list of states](https://github.com/sdelaserna/DH110-22F-Heuristics-Assignment-/blob/main/lists%20of%20states.png)

*Recommendation: Improvements were already mentioned above in the heruistics. *


#### 7: Flexibility and Efficiency of Use

**(2)** There is not much flexibility in this website as well. For the search button it should be interchangeable with finding a food bank and inverting the search for food bank to see if there are any overlapping organizations within the states. 

*Recommendation: There should also be a navigation bar for users trying to find out all the types of assistance. As of right now it's just food banks, even though in the blurb it also mentions grocery assistance* 


#### 8: Aesthetic and Minimalist Design

**(2)** There is a clear color palette consisting of grey, white, and orange. Since the topic is about food, I wish there was more vibrancy and life in the colors since grey, white, and orange gives off a distant feeling and often associated with jail. However, the typesetting varies from the logo to the actual website and it can throw users off. I also think that the locations by state should be above the latest additions instead. The symbol for the second and third column right below the banner should be different because the same one indicates the same task.


*Recommendation: The comment above has suggestions, but to summarize: more color, more pictures, change the logo, and change the symbol of the columns. Picture of this is listed in the first heuristics. *


#### 9: Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors

*(1)* When typing an incorrect city on the search query to find food pantries in your local area, it will apologize and ask the user to please try again by entering all of the information OR in a hyperlink it says: Take me to AKJSHDFAK, NC results page in orange. There is another message saying that the address is blank. 

*No improvement made. Commented on this page already on Heuristic #5*

#### 10: Help and Documentation

**(3)** There is no search bar at the top right corner. This site is purely for finding food pantries near you and it assumes that by putting the search bar at the center in the front page. I wish there were more statistics to show the importance of food pantries and how it makes an impact on the lives of others. Even in the About US, it’s the creator of the website saying I and asking any additional comments or questions. There should also be a Frequently Asked Questions page. 

#### Overall Evaluation of the FoodPantries.org:
**(3)** I think it needs help in terms of user interface. I think this was a website project with one person behind the coding and design. In fact, you can even look at the code that the person wrote by clicking on the wifi symbol at the top right corner of the page. But as I said in the beginning, I think this site could really help a lot more people when it's more appealing to look at and easier to use because then more people could share the link and those people would share--it's a chain reaction. This site needs the most help on Heuristic #8, #4, and #2. There should be links to the social media of the food banks as well if they have any (just as mentioned in the COD overall evaluation).
